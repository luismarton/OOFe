#OOFɛ (Operational Ocean Forecast Python Engine)
A set of free, open-source, portable and fast modules that provide a way to cope with the demanding requirements of routine execution of a regional ocean model written in a compiled language (namely the Regional Ocean Modelling System, ROMS, developed in Fortran) and that make the forecast process possible and fully automatic and robust.is a set of Python modules for routine execution of a regional ocean model (ROMS). Scripts in Python are combined with existing ocean model (ROMS) routines in Fortran. OOFɛ performs all complex operations with large data files involved in ocean forecasts. OOFɛ tools are open-source, robust, flexible and automatic.

Coastal and regional ocean forecasts can be currently performed on a daily basis due to the advances in numerical techniques and in computational resources. Maintenance of routine forecasts is a demanding task from the point of view of software engineering since it involves a number of new additional tasks difficult to code efficiently in the compiled languages in which ocean models are written.
